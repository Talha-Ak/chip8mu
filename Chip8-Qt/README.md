# Chip8mu (with Qt)

> A *slightly less* rudimentary implementation of a Chip-8 emulator written in C++.

This project was a simple side project, created while I was learning C++. It implements a Chip-8 system, and is able to run Chip-8 programs and games.

[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is used to display the GUI.
Currently, there is no sound.

[This guide](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) was used as the high-level overview on the implementation detail of Chip-8.
The Qt integration, actual execution loop and instructions were implemented by myself.
